// --------------------------------------------- Why we need OOPS ------------------------------------

// 1) Better readability, maintainibility and reusability.
// 2) Large enterprise softwares can be easily mase using oops concepts.

// ------------------------------------- Types of Programming Paradigms ----------------------------

// Programming paradigms basically divides on the criteria - flow of code.

// Programming Paradigms
// ├── Imperative: You define how you will get the solution using different programming designs.
// │   ├── Procedural
// │   ├── Object-Oriented
// │   ├── Concurrent / Parallel
// │   └── Event-Driven
// └── Declarative: In these, we just tell them what we want, but not define how it will be solved. System gives answers.
//     ├── Functional
//     ├── Logic
//     ├── Query-based

// -------------------------------------Procedural---------------------------------------------- 

// In this paradigm, code is organised into procedures or functions.
// There are no objects and classes.
//  Reusability is achieved using functions only.
// The program runs from top to bottom.
// E.g C, javascript( supports procedural also )

// ------------------------------------ Object Oriented-----------------------------------------

//  Code is organised in objects and classes.
// E.g Java, Javascipt ( ES6 Classes )

// ------------------------------------Event Driven ------------------------------------------ 

// Code flow is basically event driven. there is no fixed sequence.
//  E.g Javascript

// -----------------------------------Logic--------------------------------------------------

// It is a declarative paradigm language.
// Logic programming is about describing facts and rules about a problem domain and letting the computer figure out the answer using logical inference
// E.g Prolog

// Instead of saying “go to the kitchen and get milk”, you say:
// “Milk is in the fridge. Fridge is in the kitchen.”
// Then you ask: “Where is the milk?”
// The system deduces: Kitchen → Fridge → Milk

// -----------------------------------Query Based------------------------------------------------ 
// You tell what you want, system figures out how to retrieve it.
// Used for data retrival and managing
// E,g SQL

// Note: Diff between logical and query based?
// In Logical, you define rules and facts and retrival is calculated based on those rules and facts.
// But in query based, system internally know how to give you the output.
