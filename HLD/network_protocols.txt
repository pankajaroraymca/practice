What are netwrok protocols?

Network protocols are rules and standards that defines how data is transmitted, interpreted and received over the internet
Regardless of any hardware and software, two devices can comuunicate with each other.

There are several layers of Network
1. Application layers: HTTP, FTP, SMTP, Websocket
2. Transport layers: TCP/UDP
3. Link layers: Physical and data link
4. Internet Layer: Handles addressing & routing (IP).

Say you open https://example.com in your browser:
Application Layer → Browser uses HTTP/HTTPS.
Transport Layer → Uses TCP to ensure data arrives correctly.
Internet Layer → IP finds the server’s address & routes packets.
Link Layer → Wi-Fi/Ethernet transmits the raw bits.

TCP vs UDP
In TCP, connection is established between client and server. data is sent in packets, each packet is ordered. 
once it rewaches its destinaions, it is acks.
But in UDP, connection is not made, data is sent in packets but are not ordered and also not acks. It is fast as compared to TCP. 
UDP is widely used in live streaming platforms where data packets loss is not a big deal.
