A back-of-the-envelope estimation is a quick, approximate calculation of the application in terms of number of servers, cache, storage etc.
It should be a rough idea not correct numbers
THe idea is to take simple value like 1k, 1M, 10M etc for easy calculations

So we are going to get the estimation for facebook service., which includes servers, ram, and storage.
Design System such that it is scalable. But asks the interviewer do we need multiple servers, LBs, CDNs, caching techniques, write-read dbs etc.

But before this let's understand few calculation logics

3 zeroes | Thousand  | KB
6 zeroes | Million  | MB
9 zeroes | Billion  | GB
12 zeroes | Trillion  | TB
15 zeroes | Quadtrillion  | PB

Each character holds 2 bytess in unicode
Each double value holds 8 bytess
Each image average 300KB

We are assuming facebook has total 1 billion users
Around 25% user are daily active users means 250 Million
Each cusomer makes around 75 read request and 25 write request daily
Each user create 2 post daily

Storage calculation:
Each post has 1 image 250 chars
250 chars --> 500 bytes
2 post --> 1000 bytes / 1Kb
2 images --> 600Kb
Each user takes around 600Kb daily
250 Million * 600kb = 150000 GB / 150TB
So daily 150 TB is required for all active users post

Server Load Calculation:
Each user makes 100 request a day
250 Milion * 100 = 25000 Million request a day
Each day has 86400 sec, lets take 100000
25000/100000 = 0.25 Million req per second
Each operation latency is 500ms, and the server has 50 threads
So each second 100 req can be fulfilled by one server
250000/100 = 2500 servers are needed

Ram/Cache calculation
Every User last 5 post are stored in cache
Each post is aprrox 500 bytes, 5 post 2500 bytes, 2.5KB. let's take 3KB
250 Million * 3KB = 750GB RAM
Each server has 75Gb Ram, total 10 cache servers are needed.
