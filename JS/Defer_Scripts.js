// <!DOCTYPE html>
// <html>
//   <head>
//     <script src="app.js" defer></script> // the scipt is defered by using defer attribute
//   </head>
//   <body>
//     <button id="clickMe">Click Me</button>
//   </body>
// </html>

// What is the significance of this defer attribute?

// 1) The html is parsed first , and you will be able to see the web page first
// 2) Meanwhile, in the background, the sciptpt is downloaded or loaded in parallel.Meanwhile
// 3) Once the script is available, you will be able to interact with Ui

// It is helpful in when script size is large but you want user to see the ui meanwhile
